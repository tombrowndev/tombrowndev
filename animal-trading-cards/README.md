<h1>Animal Trading Cards</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

For this project, I had to create a HTML animal trading card from an image mock-up. A basic HTML structure was provided, and I had to use an external CSS style-sheet to add styling. I was free to experiment with my own CSS styles.

<h2>Reflections</h2>

I found this project very fun to complete, from learning animal facts to experimenting with style, some of which are newer styles like rounded corners and drop shadows.

A challenge for this project was to neutralise some of the browser default styling, for example on the title and the list. I used Google Chrome Developer Tools to find the styling I had to remove.

Overall, I found this project easy and fun to complete.
